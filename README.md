# Anubis
An open-source PS Vita emulator written in Rust.

## About
The PS Vita is a very interesting system, which gave me the reason to write an emulator for this system. Although the main purpose of the project is to serve as a learning project, Anubis tries to emulate the Vita as closely as possible.
The individual components, such as the CPU JIT Compiler or the GPU emulation, are split into individual crates so that they can be easily used in other projects without having to drag the entire Anubis ecosystem into them.

## Components
